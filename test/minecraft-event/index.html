    <h1>Minecraft Weapons 2024</h1>
    <p>Welcome back, it has certainly been a while!</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2 id="general-server-information">General Server Information</h2>
    <p><strong>1.21</strong></p>
    <p><code>weapons.gilfoyle.net</code></p>
    <p><strong>Thursday night: Jul 11, 2024</strong> @ 7pm EST</p>
    <p>There are <strong>six special items</strong> strewn about the server guarded in structures that protect them with mobs, traps, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>Your goal as a team is to get one member of your team to wield all of the special items at once; then, your team wins the game.</strong></p>
    <p>There are four teams (so far):</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Red</li>
    <li>Green</li>
    <li>Blue</li>
    <li>Purple</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will be assigned a team color once you join the server with your teammates.</p>
    <p>There is a modpack required to play. You can download it below.</p>
    <div class="button-container">
        <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/JD9KTE4A24#JhD8SiyO5VQa" class="button">Modpack</a>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>The modpack includes proximity chat via Simple Voice Chat. You can use this to communicate with your teammates as well as other teams; there is no central Discord server or forum for this event, so <em>physically</em> encountering other teams is the only way to communicate with them.</p>
    <p></p>

    <h2 id="team-rules">Team Rules</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Friendly fire is disabled.</li>
    <li>You can&#39;t switch teams once you are on a particular team.</li>
    <li>You can only see your teammates&#39; nametags.</li>
    <li>You cannot push your teammates (disabled collisions).</li>
    <li>You have to be loyal to your team; you cannot play for another team.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alliances are allowed, but they are based on trust alone. Anyone can betray anyone else if they&#39;re on different teams, and I won&#39;t enforce alliances.</p>

    <p></p>
    <h2 id="world-information">World Information</h2>
    <p>The world has a world border with a <strong>2560-block (160 chunk) radius</strong>.</p>
    <p>The Nether is disabled.</p>
    <p><strong>Some structures have special items, some don&#39;t</strong>. I&#39;ve tried to make this obvious, but clues will help you know for sure.</p>
    <p>You can pay for me to give your team clues regarding locations of the special items. Prices are listed below.</p>
    <p><strong>Clue Prices</strong></p>
    <pre><code>
    Random item's x-coordinate: 12 iron
    Random item's y-coordinate: 4 iron
    Random item's z-coordinate: 12 iron
    ~
    Specific item's x-coordinate: 24 iron
    Specific item's y-coordinate: 8 iron
    Specific item's z-coordinate: 24 iron
    ~
    Random item location screenshot: 1 diamond
    Specific weapon location screenshot: 2 diamonds
    </code></pre>
    <p>Screenshots paid for by any individual team will be available for <em>everyone</em> playing, and will be posted on this page. Keep an eye out for them!</p>

    <p>In addition to the six special items, there is an additional <strong>superweapon</strong> reserved for when four of the special items have been discovered. Your team may only obtain it if you have <strong>one or fewer special items in your collective possession</strong>. Keep this in mind for when your team is down on its luck!</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>I&#39;ll add stuff here as I think of it before Thursday night. In the meantime, enjoy the anticipation!</p>
