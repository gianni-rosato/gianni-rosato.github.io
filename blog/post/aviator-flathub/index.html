      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        First, you can install <a
          href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.natesales.Aviator"
        >here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enable simple, accessible AV1 encoding for the masses via Flathub.
        See my post about rAV1ator <a
          href="https://giannirosato.com/blog/post/aviator-1/"
        >here</a> for the rav1e + av1an based version of this utility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aviator has used SVT-AV1 &amp; FFmpeg for a while, but has been missing
        a couple key features including a progress bar, a stop encode button,
        and more buttons on the header bar then just the close button. I've been
        glad to make this release available on Flathub, but I think it has
        surfaced some serious issues with how Flathub allows you to build
        applications.
      </p>
      <h2>rAV1ator vs Aviator: Flathub</h2>
      <p>
        There's <a href="https://github.com/flathub/flathub/issues/3392"
        >an open issue</a> regarding exactly my complaint here, which is that
        Flathub doesn't allow <code>--share=network</code> in the build-args.
        This places an undue burden on the developer to jump through extra hoops
        to make "reproducible builds," which I could guess there is potential to
        do with crypto instead of putting it on the dev. I champion Flatpak
        because of its superb user experience and seamless integration with the
        Linux desktop, but from a developer standpoint it is a nightmare of
        quirks &amp; workarounds that require a depth of experience that many
        simply do not possess. Even if I did have such experience, I'm not sure
        how I'd be able to ship rAV1ator on Flathub with such a hurdle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aviator is great, and I'd easily recommend to anyone interested in video
        encoding. But I'd like it to be the best I can make it, and Flathub is
        simply not allowing this to happen. Hopefully with enough complaining
        we'll be able to fix things, but the light at the end of the tunnel
        doesn't seem to be approaching very quickly.
