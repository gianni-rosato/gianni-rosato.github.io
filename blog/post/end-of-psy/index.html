        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          SVT-AV1-PSY, a community fork of the SVT-AV1 video encoder, was
          created to enhance perceptual quality and ease of use for AV1
          encoding. I co-created and currently maintain the project. It gained
          significant traction through our perceptual fidelity enhancements for
          videos and still images, but due to life circumstances, myself and
          another main contributor are stepping back from our involvement. Our
          new goal is merging as many of our features as possible into SVT-AV1.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>
        If you aren't familiar with codecs or AV1, I'm not sure why you're on my
        site. Nevertheless, here's some background:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          AV1 is a modern video codec, meant to make videos smaller and better
          looking
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlike H.264 and H.265, AV1 is royalty-free, meaning you don't have to
          pay to use it
        </li>
        <li>
          There are three very popular AV1 encoders that can be used to produce
          AV1 video: libaom, rav1e, and SVT-AV1
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Encoders</h3>
      <p>
        There are three main AV1 encoders, as mentioned above: libaom from
        Google, rav1e from xiph, and SVT-AV1 from Intel, Netflix, Meta, and
        others. Historically, SVT-AV1 has been noteworthy for its impressive
        speed and parallelism, while libaom was known for its great quality and
        class-leading still image performance (AV1 has an image format
        associated with it called AVIF).
      </p>
      <h3>Forks</h3>
      <p>
        The libaom team at Google is largely insulated from community influence;
        this means a random individual submitting some new code has a low chance
        of it being accepted. This led to a community culture of forking, with
        the first noteworthy fork being <a
          href="https://github.com/BlueSwordM/aom-av1-psy"
        >aom-av1-psy</a> by BlueSwordM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this fork was to enhance libaom (aomenc) with better
        perceptual quality. This means that the encoder would be able to make
        better decisions about what to keep and what to throw away according to
        our eyes, instead of chasing metric scores that, while important, don't
        always reflect the characteristics of the human visual system.
        BlueSwordM retired aom-av1-psy in September of 2022 to focus on other
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perceptual fidelity is not a new concept; encoders like x264 and x265
        have a number of perceptually focused features like "psy-rd" and
        "psy-trellis" (you can read more about these elsewhere). x264 and x265
        are very mature encoders for older formats, so mainstream AV1 encoders
        haven't had the same level of development in this area. This helped
        aom-av1-psy become very popular among AV1 enthusiasts, and its legacy
        lives on in the form of two newer forks: <a
          href="https://wiki.x266.mov/docs/encoders/aom-av1-lavish"
        >aom-av1-lavish</a> (retired as of June 2024) and <a
          href="https://wiki.x266.mov/docs/encoders/aom-psy101"
        >aom-psy101</a> (still maintained at the time of writing).
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, forks were maintained by a single individual – all of the forks
        I've mentioned so far have been or currently are. Coding isn't the only
        thing that goes into maintaining a project, so a solo dev is often
        responsible for documentation, community management, releases, bug
        reports, feature requests, testing, and more. This puts pressure on a
        singular developer to manage a rather complex project with a lot of eyes
        on it, which is difficult and has often led to project maintenance
        issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this had been swirling around in my head at the time, because
        compiling aom-av1-lavish by collecting the latest experimental patches
        floating around Discord was kind of difficult and I was keenly
        interested in what a new project isolated from the aom-av1-psy legacy
        might look like. This brings us to SVT-AV1-PSY.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        I had entertained little discussions with friends about what kind of
        potential SVT-AV1 might have in 2023. The community often doesn't care
        much about speed versus perceptual quality, so many weren't that
        invested in seeing what could come out of SVT-AV1 as the aomenc forks
        were (and have always been) quite good. The rav1e encoder already had a
        perceptual lean, so many thought the path forward was clearly to invest
        as much community time as possible into rav1e. I thought this would be a
        herculean effort that would likely not pay off, and I was convinced that
        SVT-AV1 had something to offer with the incredible year over year speed
        improvements we kept on seeing. However, I never once thought of
        forking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coincidentally, at this point <a
          href="https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/-/issues/2105"
        >a perceptual quality-related issue</a> appeared in the SVT-AV1 GitLab
        repository. This piqued my attention immediately, and the initial
        results that Variance Boost was producing looked extremely promising.
        While the author, Julio Barba, was sharing patch files to communicate
        with the dev team, excited community members were manually patching the
        source code and building the encoder to test it out. I was one of those
        people, and I was very impressed with the results, but the patching
        workflow was cumbersome and reminded me of my current woes with
        aom-av1-lavish. So, I hastily put together a GitHub repository with the
        patch applied to the SVT-AV1 source code alongside some minor tweaks
        from an SVT-AV1 fork maintained by BlueSwordM. I called it SVT-AV1-PSY,
        named after aom-av1-psy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Julio ended up appearing across the various AV1 Discord servers run by
        community members, and BlueSwordM was able to get in touch with me about
        how I was integrating and testing his work. I offered to maintain the
        project while Julio and BlueSwordM would act as the primary
        contributors, so they could focus on code while I dealt with everything
        else. We made our first release in February of 2024, and the project
        began to gain traction from there.
      </p>
      <h2>How It's Going</h2>
      <p>
        Although I didn't intend to do much programming to start, it was too
        tantalizing, and I had just begun learning C in October of 2023 so I
        thought I would try my hand. In the end, everyone on the dev team ended
        up contributing code, and we also attracted the attention of Clybius –
        the maintainer of aom-av1-lavish – who stopped working on his
        aom-av1-psy fork to join us. Trix, a noteworthy encoder known for their
        work with animation, also joined the team and provided us with a lot of
        valuable feedback through their extensive testing in the <a
          href="https://wiki.x266.mov/blog/svt-av1-third-deep-dive"
        >SVT-AV1 Deep Dive</a> blog series.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could not have asked for a better group of people to work with. The
        amount I have learned through them, especially Julio, has been
        immeasurable, and I wouldn't be nearly as competent as I am now without
        them. I am very grateful for their time and effort, and I am proud of
        what we have accomplished together.
      </p>
      <p>Here's a short list of what has been achieved with SVT-AV1-PSY:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We've authored over 20 highly effective features, aimed at improving
          perceptual quality and ease of use
        </li>
        <li>
          We have produced a total of 13 releases at the time of writing,
          introducing our own release cadence to help push finished features to
          users faster
        </li>
        <li>
          We've built a community of over 500 members on the <a
            href="https://discord.gg/bbQD5MjDr3"
          >AV1 for Dummies</a> Discord server, where discussion mainly revolves
          around SVT-AV1-PSY and related projects
        </li>
        <li>
          We've racked up over 250 stars on GitHub at the time of writing (more
          than SVT-AV1! Though that's likely due to GitHub vs GitLab)
        </li>
        <li>
          We have a <a href="https://svt-av1-psy.com/">website</a> for showing
          off our results, where we notably demonstrate our <a
            href="https://svt-av1-psy.com/avif/"
          >AVIF performance</a>. At its inception, AVIF with SVT-AV1-PSY was the
          best in the world by a wide margin; libaom is competitive now due to
          the introduction of our breakthrough changes into libaom
        </li>
        <li>
          We've recently forged a relationship with the incredibly responsive
          and talented mainline SVT-AV1 team, and we are working to get our
          features merged into the mainline encoder so everyone can enjoy them
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        SVT-AV1-PSY is the most popular community fork of a major AV1 encoder,
        and I am very proud of what we have accomplished. I am excited to see
        where we go from here, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have
        worked with such talented and dedicated individuals. I am also grateful
        for the community that has supported us, and I hope we can continue to
        provide you even more exciting compression technology in the future.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Ended (?)</h2>
      <p>
        Full disclosure, SVT-AV1-PSY isn't "ending," per se – that was just some
        clickbait. We are in the process of getting as many of our features as
        possible merged into the mainline SVT-AV1 encoder, and we are working
        closely with the mainline team to see that through. What's happening
        next is that we are slowly rolling back our involvement in SVT-AV1-PSY.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to life, work, and other extenuating circumstances, both myself and
        Julio are going to be taking a step back from heavily contributing to
        the project for the time being. I am still going to be around to help
        out as the maintainer, but we are going to be less active in the
        day-to-day operations of the project. As of January 2025, I'm going to
        be stepping back from authoring perceptual quality and performance
        changes for reasons I will disclose soon; my involvement will mostly
        consist of maintaining the project and helping out with the mainline
        integration going forward through December.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully this isn't a disappointing announcement; I think it is
        incredibly exciting that the community is in a position to contribute to
        mainline SVT-AV1 directly, and a fork only serves to duplicate efforts
        on that front. SVT-AV1-PSY was always meant to be a temporary project,
        and started as a playground for testing new features that may not have
        been production-ready immediately. I am very proud of what we have
        accomplished, and I am excited to see what the future holds for SVT-AV1.
      </p>
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        I am a big believer in the idea that breakthrough compression
        performance enables brand-new applications for multimedia tech, and
        compression doesn't solely exist to make video files smaller for the
        benefit of the corporate bottom line. Saying good compression only
        exists to save X% bandwidth is akin to saying post production only
        exists to drive X% more sales; post production and visual art are
        creative and expressive, and compression is a tool to enable that
        creativity in ways that we likely can't imagine yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am humbled to be a part of a community that is pushing the boundaries
        of what is possible with video compression, and to have contributed my
        drop in the bucket with SVT-AV1-PSY. I am excited to see where things go
        from here, and I'm hopefully not leaving the multimedia compression
        world anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you to Julio, BlueSwordM, and Clybius for all of your help, and
        thank you to the community for your support. I am excited to see what
        the future holds!
