        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The past two years have seen significant advancements in video and
          image compression, particularly with the maturation of the SVT-AV1
          video encoder and improvements to AVIF image compression. These
          developments, coupled with faster and more accessible developer tools,
          have made it easier to produce high-quality compressed media. I have a
          lot of optimism for the future with AV2 and the potential for further
          community-driven innovation in open-source compression technology.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        When you work on anything, I think it is worth thinking about why you
        are working on it aside from whether or not it provides some instant
        gratification. Thinking about what the core purpose of video and image
        compression might be, it is easy to land on a simple conclusion: smaller
        images and (especially) videos make the internet cheaper. Video makes up
        the vast majority of internet bandwidth, so small gains add up. However,
        this prompts further questioning; what might the end game be for
        compression? For the average person, what is the deliverable derived
        from compression technology indistinguishable from magic?
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this final goal is <strong>beautiful multimedia accessible
          anywhere</strong>. In other words, an artist's vision is not served
        half-baked to any sub-section of their audience. Compression doesn't
        just make the internet cheaper, it also makes it more beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most revolutionary compression technology has been able to unlock
        new experiences for people creating and experiencing art. If you look at
        the history of video, this is illustrated by certain major leaps made
        over time. Every breakthrough represents a widening of the pipeline
        between artist and audience. Let's look at the timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Video begins as something you experience at a theater; people travel
        to see certain videos at specific times, and then maybe never again.
        Video doesn't look that great, and for a while, it doesn't have sound or
        color.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Analog broadcast television lets people see certain videos at specific
        times anywhere that has the right equipment. At some point, video gets
        color.
      </p>
      <p>
        – VCRs enable time-shifted viewing; you can see certain videos at almost
        any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Digital optical discs improve upon the last step by providing better
        looking videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        – The world of digital internet video emerges through peer-to-peer
        downloads. Now you can see pretty much any video anywhere after waiting
        for a download. Regardless of your internet connection, a smaller file
        means a faster download.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Streaming platforms make on-demand web video real; now you can watch
        pretty much any video anywhere with a good internet connection almost
        instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Smartphones proliferate; smarter compression and streaming technology
        means we can do what we did in the last step on most internet
        connections, allowing people to access virtually any video almost
        anywhere on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        – Today, beautiful video is no longer exclusive to Blu-ray; high-end
        streaming services provide access to high-fidelity video anywhere with
        decent internet. Additionally, live video platforms let anyone show lots
        of people a window into their life from almost anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the combined efforts of better internet and better compression,
        we could see more breakthroughs in the future. Emerging immersive
        formats (360° video, VR/AR) and cloud gaming are opportunities for more
        innovation, and could unlock compelling art with enough accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, it is worth acknowledging that we've come a really long way.
      </p>
      <h2>Present Day</h2>
      <p>
        The past two years have been incredibly consequential for video. I would
        argue this is the strongest the ecosystem has been in over a decade from
        a technological standpoint. The best open-source video encoder in the
        world is beginning to show signs of maturity, web-first image
        compression had its first major breakthrough since JPEG, and life has
        become a lot easier for developers. Let's walk through each of these
        stories.
      </p>
      <h3>Video</h3>
      <p>
        SVT-AV1 is the best open-source video encoder in the world, according to
        a lot of metrics. Despite this, it is still not the most mature (that
        title goes to x264). For SVT-AV1 to fully supersede x264, it needs to
        <em>always</em> be better; it cannot just be <em>mostly</em> better.
        Metrics say we are already here, but subjective testing tells a
        different story.
      </p>
      <p>
        One year ago (August 2024), the predominant narrative around AV1 was
        that it was "blurry". Time and energy were invested in swaying this
        perception, but it ultimately still held. To address this, I had started
        the SVT-AV1-PSY project earlier that year with the stated goal of
        building and testing research-grade features for subjective quality
        based on user feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        In August 2025, this perception has mostly been shattered. A number of
        the aforementioned research-grade features have been upgraded to
        production-grade, with more progress happening every day. Additionally,
        the number of features has ballooned; SVT-AV1-PSY saw a number of
        additional releases, and as the project was put to rest, a few new forks
        emerged to perpetuate the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        Utilities for using video encoders have improved dramatically as well;
        the popular chunked encoding script called Av1an saw a development
        resurgence to reinvigorate some older features, and other tools with
        similar functionality arrived on the scene to provide more options to
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implications of these dramatic improvements are numbered. As an
        enthusiast, it is no longer as easy to avoid producing good-looking AV1
        video. SVT-AV1 is arguably more mature than x265, and x264 is the final
        available contender. Considering it takes the better part of a decade to
        develop a robust video encoder, the fact that so much is in motion <em
        >right now</em> is exciting news.
      </p>
      <h3>Images</h3>
      <p>
        In August 2024, the image compression story was looking unfortunate
        compared to video. WebP failed to deliver exceptional compression
        improvements over modern JPEG encoders, and AVIF was looking promising
        but underwhelming. It suffered from the same "blurriness" as AV1, but it
        was far more severe in a world where modern image encoders tend to be
        well-optimized for human perception. The best standard by far was JPEG
        XL, which had been removed from Chrome, effectively killing any chance
        of ubiquitous use of the format on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        While all of this held true, in August <a href="https://juliobbv.com"
        >Julio Barba</a> and I were working on <a
          href="https://svt-av1-psy.com/avif/"
        >image-focused enhancements for SVT-AV1-PSY</a>. We announced our
        results publicly, and while they were promising, the implementation was
        limited to our community-supported video encoder.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2025, Julio has worked diligently with Google to bring our work to
        libaom, the reference implementation of AV1. Due to its more complete
        feature set, it already has a number of image-specific performance
        considerations, so it was a perfect fit. The new improvements are
        wrapped into Tune IQ in libaom, and websites like <a
          href="https://bsky.app/profile/giannirosato.com/post/3lv7ijrdbbs2n"
        >The Guardian</a> are already benefiting from its vastly improved
        consistency and compression gains. Before Tune IQ, AVIF would
        occasionally lose to JPEG; this is no longer true.
      </p>
      <h3>Developers</h3>
      <p>
        In August 2024, everyone's favorite metric is <a
          href="https://github.com/cloudinary/ssimulacra2/blob/main/README.md"
        >SSIMULACRA2</a>. It is incredibly accurate to human visual perception,
        and helped guide certain decisions made during SVT-AV1-PSY development.
        It had a couple of issues, though.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The reference implementation in C doesn't support videos</li>
        <li>The Rust implementation <code>ssimulacra2_rs</code> is not fast</li>
        <li>
          The <a
            href="https://github.com/dnjulek/vapoursynth-ssimulacra2/commits/main/"
          >Zig implementation</a> is decently fast, but still not as fast as
          VMAF, SSIM or PSNR
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Enter <a href="https://github.com/Line-fr/Vship">Vship</a>, an
        SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli implementation that uses the GPU. Better
        developer tools enable new development paradigms, and Vship's 10–100x
        speed improvement opened the doors for encoder testing frameworks like
        <a href="https://github.com/psy-ex/metrics">PSY-EX `metrics`</a> that
        allow for streamlined encoder benchmarking automation. My blog post on
        <a href="https://giannirosato.com/blog/post/comparing-encoders/"
        >comparing video encoders</a> would have been a lot longer and more
        complex in 2024, but now testing an encoder's convex hull is as simple
        as running a single Bash script to call PSY-EX <code>metrics</code>
        tooling powered by Vship.
      </p>
      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <p>
        I have a lot of hope that AV2 will rally intense community efforts in
        open source like AV1 did. There is a lot of performance left on the
        table with a standard as complex as AV2, and I hope in the next decade
        it will be properly realized.
      </p>
      <p>For now, I think we should celebrate what has happened so far.</p>
      <p>AV1 currently features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An innovative open-source decoder (dav1d) that has outperformed
          everyone's initial expectations for AV1
        </li>
        <li>
          A performant, competitive reference encoder that is still seeing
          developments right now, for both images and videos
        </li>
        <li>
          A competitive, performant open-source production encoder that has
          driven dedicated psychovisual feature implementations
        </li>
        <li>An independent encoder in Rust</li>
        <li>
          Some proprietary solutions that offer extra value (features,
          performance, quality, etc) to select clients
        </li>
        <li>
          Vibrant online compression communities that are drawn to the field out
          of pure passion
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the past year, we've seen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Major advances in maturity in the world's best open-source video
          encoder
        </li>
        <li>
          The first image compression implementation available on any browser
          that meaningfully surpasses JPEG
        </li>
        <li>Faster, easier-to-use developer tools than ever before</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm excited for what the next year of development has to offer.</p>
